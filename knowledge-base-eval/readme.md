### Detailed Knowledge Base Evaluation Criteria
KnowledgeBase Scoring Standards (Base score 10 points for each sub-item)
| Evaluation Item | Sub-item | Weight | Scoring Standard | Deduction Criteria |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----|:----|
| Embedding Model | compatibility | 0.25 | 1-3 points: Only supports a single, fixed low-performance model.<br>4-6 points: Supports several preset general models.<br>7-8 points: Supports user import or configuration of multiple mainstream models.<br>9-10 points: Provides a model management platform with evaluation, comparison, and automatic recommendation. | 1.After switching models, the existing knowledge base index is not automatically rebuilt, causing retrieval failure (deduct 2 points)<br>2.Uploaded custom model format is not supported or fails to load (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Model inference resource usage is too high with no optimization options (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Ease of Use | 0.25 | 1-3 points: Only supports manual text input addition.<br>4-6 points: Supports document upload but with single format.<br>7-8 points: Fully supports document/web page upload, manual input, modification/deletion, freezing, and provides basic chunking rule settings.<br>9-10 points: Supports batch upload of various document formats, provides visual chunking rule editor, and supports version management. | 1.Document upload fails without clear error reason (deduct 1 point)<br>2.After modifying/deleting documents, index updates are delayed or unsuccessful (deduct 2 points)<br>3.Chunking rule settings are invalid and still split according to default rules (deduct 1 point)<br>4."Freeze document" function fails, frozen documents are still retrieved (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Retrieval Accuracy | 0.15 | 1-3 points: Very low recall rate (Recall@5 < 30%). For explicit questions, the system frequently misses the most critical related documents, only able to recall a small amount or completely irrelevant content.<br>4-6 points: Lower recall rate (Recall@5 between 30%-60%). Can recall some related documents but often misses key information, requiring users to ask multiple times or search manually.<br>7-8 points: Good recall rate (Recall@5 between 60%-85%). For the vast majority of questions, most related documents can be recalled, occasionally missing some edge or detail information. 9-10 points: Extremely high recall rate (Recall@5 > 85%). The system has strong recall capability, almost always finding all related document fragments, providing a solid foundation for subsequent reranking and generation. | 1.Serious omission: For a query with multiple clear answers, the system only recalls one or zero (deduct 2 points)<br>2.Synonym/ near-synonym failure: For queries using synonyms or near-synonyms, the system cannot recall corresponding documents (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Poor conceptual generalization ability: For abstract concepts or hypernyms queries, cannot recall documents containing specific instances or hyponyms (deduct 1 point)<br>4.Poor handling of long-tail questions: For uncommon but actually existing answers in the knowledge base, recall fails (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Performance | 0.1 | 1-3 points: Query latency extremely high (>2s).<br>4-6 points: Query latency relatively high (500ms-2s).<br>7-8 points: Query latency good (<500ms), supports higher concurrency.<br>9-10 points: Query latency extremely low (<200ms), supports high concurrency. | 1. As data volume increases, query performance drops sharply (deduct 2 points)<br>2.Service becomes unavailable with slightly higher concurrent requests (e.g., >50 QPS) (deduct 2 points)<br>3.Initial query (cold start) latency far exceeds normal levels (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Interpretability | 0.05 | 1-3 points: Only returns result content, no source information.<br>4-6 points: Provides original document source of results.<br>7-8 points: Precisely returns matching text fragments and similarity scores.<br>9-10 points: Provides complete visualization of retrieval path. | 1.Returned source document links or IDs are invalid (deduct 1 point)<br>2.Matching text fragment does not match query content (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Similarity score calculation is inaccurate or unstable (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Maintainability | 0.05 | 1-3 points: No management interface or tools whatsoever.<br>4-6 points: Provides basic Web UI for simple operations.<br>7-8 points: Provides fully functional management backend.<br>9-10 points: Provides one-stop knowledge base development platform. | 1.Management backend operations are laggy or slow to respond (deduct 1 point)<br>2.Lack of index status monitoring, unable to understand system health (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Insufficient log information, unable to troubleshoot indexing or retrieval issues (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | API Usage | 0.05 | 1-3 points: Does not provide any API, all operations must be completed manually in the UI.<br>4-6 points: Provides basic API but with incomplete functionality (e.g., only supports querying, not adding/deleting/modifying), and documentation is missing or incorrect.<br>7-8 points: Provides fully functional RESTful API covering core add/delete/modify/query functions, and provides clear, accurate API documentation.<br>9-10 points: Provides high-performance, well-designed API gateway, supports multiple authentication methods, and provides SDK and API version control strategy. | 1.API response time is too long, seriously affecting caller performance (deduct 2 points)<br>2.API error codes are unclearly defined, HTTP status codes are used improperly (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Lack of API authentication mechanism or single/insecure authentication method (deduct 2 points)<br>4.API documentation does not match actual functionality, or lacks key parameter descriptions (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Data Multimodality | 0.1 | 1-3 points: Only supports plain text data processing<br>4-6 points: Supports basic image document (such as images in PDF) OCR recognition<br>7-8 points: Supports unified processing and retrieval of text, image, audio, video and other multimodal data<br>9-10 points: Provides cross-modal retrieval capability, supports semantic understanding and associative retrieval of graphic, audio and video multimodal content | 1.Image/audio/video file upload fails or cannot be parsed (deduct 2 points)<br>2.Cross-modal retrieval results are inaccurate or irrelevant (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Multimodal data fusion processing effect is poor (deduct 1 point)<br>4.Lack of support for specific format multimodal data (deduct 1 point) |
| Usability Criteria | Security | 0.1 | 1-3 points: No security protection measures whatsoever, data stored in plaintext<br>4-6 points: Basic identity authentication, simple permission control<br>7-8 points: Complete permission management system, encrypted data storage and transmission<br>9-10 points: Enterprise-level security architecture, supports audit logs, data desensitization, compliance certification | 1.Sensitive data is not encrypted (deduct 2 points)<br>2.Permission control fails, users can access unauthorized data (deduct 2 points)<br>3.Lack of operation audit logs (deduct 1 point)<br>4.API interfaces lack security authentication (deduct 2 points) |
| Usability Criteria | Strong Real-time Performance | 0.1 | 1-3 points: Data update delay extremely high (>10 minutes), index rebuilding takes too long<br>4-6 points: Data update delay relatively high (1-10 minutes), basically meets real-time requirements<br>7-8 points: Data update delay good (<1 minute), supports incremental updates<br>9-10 points: Data update delay extremely low (<10 seconds), supports streaming real-time processing | 1.After data update, index does not take effect in time, causing delayed query results (deduct 2 points)<br>2.System unavailable during batch data import (deduct 1 point)<br>3.Real-time data synchronization fails or is lost (deduct 2 points) |
